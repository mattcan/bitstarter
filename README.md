This is a crowd funding tool that is part of the final project for the Startup Engineering course from Coursera.

## What are you crowd funding?

My goal is to fund a personal API and dashboard for fans of the Quantified Self movement. Money would go towards hosting, a domain name, and my development time. The plan is to make it open source and use the hosting for people who don't want to host the project themselves.
